This will serve as my portfolio page for job seeking.

## Motivation

* I needed a website where all of my projects can be housed, and shared with potential employers.

## Problems Solved

* Flexbox positioning issues

* HTML up to accessibility standards

* Cleaned up the style.css sheet by optimizing classes/id's with their associated HTML elements and combined several stylings to shorten the overall length of the styling sheet.

* Navigation buttons jump down to respective sections.

* All fixes done without changing the overall look of the page.

## Lessons Learned

* Major learnings in understanding how to build a flexbox website. Starting from the bigger picture, going one object at a time, and adding the details later.

* How to properly use classes and id's to assist in making the style sheet concise, and not repetitive.

* How to create website interaction with hover and click.

* How to make a mobile responsive website.

## Features

1. Navigation jumps down to their respective sections on the page.
2. CLickable images that bring employer to my work.
3. Flexbox navigation and footer.
